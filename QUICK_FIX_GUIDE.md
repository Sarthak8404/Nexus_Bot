# 🚨 Quick Fix Guide - Telegram Bot Not Responding

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Debugging

### Step 1: Check if Backend is Running
```bash
python debug_telegram.py
```
This will test if your Flask server is running.

### Step 2: Verify Your Bot Token
1. Go to Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
2. Send `/mybots` to see your bots
3. Click on your bot and go to "API Token"
4. Copy the token (looks like: `123456789:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz`)

### Step 3: Get Your Chat ID
1. Start a conversation with your bot on Telegram
2. Send `/start` to your bot
3. Visit: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_TOKEN>/getUpdates`
4. Look for `"chat":{"id":123456789}` in the response
5. Copy that number

### Step 4: Test Everything
Run the debug script:
```bash
python debug_telegram.py
```

   - Go to dashboard → Analytics → Integration Settings
   - Enable Telegram Bot
   - Paste your token
   - Click Save Settings

2. **Test with curl:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/telegram/test-message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "your_user_id",
    "message": "What cakes do you have?",
    "chat_id": "your_chat_id"
  }'
```

3. **Check the Flask server logs** for detailed error messages.

## 📱 Quick Test Checklist

- [ ] Flask server is running (`python app.py`)
- [ ] Bot token is valid (test with debug script)
- [ ] Chat ID is correct (test with debug script)
- [ ] Telegram settings are saved in dashboard
- [ ] You've started a conversation with your bot
- [ ] You have data uploaded and stored in ChromaDB

## 🆘 Still Not Working?

1. **Check the Flask logs** - they now have detailed debugging info
2. **Run the debug script** - it will identify the exact issue
3. **Try the manual curl test** - bypasses the frontend
4. **Check your browser console** - look for JavaScript errors
